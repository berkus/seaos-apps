.SH SYNOPSIS
abort \- abnormal termination of a program
.SH ANSI_SYNOPSIS
#include <stdlib.h>
.br
void abort(void);
.br
.SH TRAD_SYNOPSIS
#include <stdlib.h>
.br
void abort();
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Use 
.BR abort 
to signal that your program has detected a condition it
cannot deal with. Normally, 
.BR abort 
ends your program's execution.

Before terminating your program, 
.BR abort 
raises the exception 
.BR SIGABRT 
(using `
.BR raise(SIGABRT) ').
If you have used 
.BR signal 
to register
an exception handler for this condition, that handler has the
opportunity to retain control, thereby avoiding program termination.

In this implementation, 
.BR abort 
does not perform any stream- or
file-related cleanup (the host environment may do so; if not, you can
arrange for your program to do its own cleanup with a 
.BR SIGABRT 
exception handler).
.SH RETURNS
.BR abort 
does not return to its caller.
.SH PORTABILITY
ANSI C requires 
.BR abort .

Supporting OS subroutines required: 
.BR _exit 
and optionally, 
.BR write .
